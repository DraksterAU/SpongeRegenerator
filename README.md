# SpongeRegenerator
Regenerator, but for Sponge!

This plugin has been put on hold as the Sponge API does not support generation/regeneration yet. 
Once WorldEdit supports Sponge I will develop Regenerator for Sponge.

To clarify, Regenerator does not rely on WorldEdit... Regenerator relies on some similar methods existing in the Sponge API.
